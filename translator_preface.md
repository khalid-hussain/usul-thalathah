In the name of Allāh the Entirely Merciful the Especially Merciful.

All praise is for Allāh and may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon our
Prophet, his family, his companions and those who follow them.

What follows:

This is a translation of the three principles and its proofs by Shaykh Muḥammad
ibn ʿAbd\ al-Wahhāb ibn Sulaymān al-Tamīmī \BM_HIM.

This translation was based upon the Arabic text that was prepared by Shaykh
Ṣāliḥ ibn ʿAbd\ Allāh ibn Ḥamad? al-ʿUsaymī \BH_HIM in the texts that he put
together in his program [مهمات العلم]{custom-style="In-text Arabic" dir="rtl"}
in the 2017 edition.

I benefitted from some of the previous translations. Me too.
